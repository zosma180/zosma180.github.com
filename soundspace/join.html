        Sharing information about audio games
      </label><br>

        Discussing accessibility
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q1" value="c" required>
        Participating in a healthy community where it's pleasant to write and read others' messages. Any topics revolves around this basic idea.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q1" value="d" required>
        Discussing technology
      </label>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <h3>A member of the group shares a song generated with AI.</h3>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q2" value="a" required>
        I'm intimidated by AI, there are many people in the world with the same fear, so I write a message to the person who shared the song that it's wrong to use AI and I won't listen to that song out of respect for musicians.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q2" value="b" required>
        I had a direct negative experience with the use of AI, so I have full right to highlight to everyone how that technology is wrong.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q2" value="c" required>
        I'm intimidated by AI, even if I have a different opinion, I avoid writing a critical message in the group because my opinion is based on personal fear and rationally I'm aware that AI is a tool that can be used in many different ways. I can choose not to listen to the song without having to communicate it in the group.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q2" value="d" required>
        I'm in favor of AI, so I emphasize how useful its use is by criticizing those who instead fear it.
      </label>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <h3>A member shares an audio game created in their free time. The game is simple but accessible and allows me to have fun for a few hours.</h3>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a" required>
        I send a message saying that I had fun and even if the creator didn't ask for it, I propose extensive modifications to the gameplay and sounds according to how they could be better from my point of view.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b" required>
        Even though I had fun, I avoid highlighting it because the creator of the game will already be aware of their work. I limit myself to reporting improvements that I find indispensable because it would be a pity for them not to add them.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q3" value="c" required>
        I struggled a lot to play, so I send a message writing that unfortunately the game is not for everyone. This way, I'll warn other people who might have the same difficulties.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q3" value="d" required>
        I reflect on the fact that the creator dedicated a lot of time to offer everyone a pastime, so I sincerely thank them for the gesture.
        Then I highlight the things that I liked the most and the positive emotions.
        If the creator asked for it, I can propose modifications, aware that these are anyway personal aspects that might only interest me.
      </label>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <h3>I sent a message asking for information. I don't receive a response for a long time.</h3>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a" required>
        If no one responds, it means that I'm not welcome.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b" required>
        I insist until someone deigns to give me an answer because it's a matter of respect among civilized people.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q4" value="c" required>
        If the response times are too long, then it's not worth participating.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q4" value="d" required>
        Even if it's a chat, people are not required to give me timely responses. This doesn't mean that they have something against me but simply that they are not available at that moment. I'll wait for a response with patience and if it doesn't arrive, I'll try to ask again in the future.
      </label>
    </fieldset>

    <fieldset>
      <h3>I write a message that unintentionally violates one of the group's behavior rules and get reprimanded by the administrator.</h3>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a" required>
        I didn't notice, so it's not my fault.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b" required>
        I discuss with the administrator because the rule is not clear or I find it incorrect.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q5" value="c" required>
        I briefly apologize and reflect on what I did wrong and how I can avoid the same situation again.
      </label><br>
      <label>
        <input type="radio" name="q5" value="d" required>
        Since my intentions were positive, I ask if it's possible to lighten the rule.
      </label>
